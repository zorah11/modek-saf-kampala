## Project Overview
MODEK collects used cooking oil from households and businesses in Uganda and converts it into Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This reduces environmental pollution, supports green aviation, and creates income opportunities.

## Problem Statement
Used cooking oil is often wasted, causing pollution and missed economic opportunities. MODEK provides an efficient collection system for SAF production.

## Solution
We collect and process used cooking oil to supply Sustainable Aviation Fuel, turning waste into value while benefiting the environment and local communities.
